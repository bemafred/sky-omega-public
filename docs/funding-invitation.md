# Invitation to Collaborate, Support, and Seed the Future

Sky Omega is not a product.  
It is not a startup, an API, or a business plan.

It is a quiet revolution—emerging from the codebase outward.  
A new way of working with knowledge, intelligence, and one another.

And it is happening now.

## 🫂 Why We’re Sharing This

We created this public window into Sky Omega to *show*, not sell.  
To let the vision breathe.  
To find resonance before seeking resources.

But the truth is: this work deserves to grow.

And for that, we invite…

- **Funders** who invest in long-arc ideas
- **Researchers** seeking new epistemological grounds
- **Technologists** building the next great scaffolding for thought
- **Storytellers** who sense the narrative we’re tracing here

---

## 💠 What You Can Support

We are seeking aligned partners—those who see beyond short-term ROI.

Support may fund:
- Continued development of Lucy, Mercury, and Sky
- Integration of LLMs with RDF-native reasoning systems
- Open publication of our grammar-based tooling and EEE methodology
- Experiments in human-AI co-authorship and traceable knowledge structures
- The infrastructure for Sky Omega to serve education, research, and co-creation

## ✨ What You’ll Be Part Of

By supporting Sky Omega, you don’t just fund a project.  
You **join** it.

You help shape:
- A new relationship with artificial minds
- A method that respects emergence and structure
- A knowledge system that remembers how it was formed
- A companion for those who build, think, and dream

## What's Already Public

**The substrate is open.**

[Mercury](https://github.com/bemafred/sky-omega) — the high-performance RDF/SPARQL engine at the heart of Sky Omega — is now public under the MIT license. This includes:

* Zero-GC, bitemporal RDF quad store
* Full SPARQL 1.1 Query and Update (94/94 W3C conformance)
* B+Tree indexes with memory-mapped storage
* Streaming parsers for Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads, TriG, RDF/XML, JSON-LD
* OWL/RDFS reasoning, federated queries, full-text search
* Production-ready, BCL-only (no external dependencies)

The engine is free. Use it. Build on it. The code speaks for itself.

**What partnership unlocks:**

* Integration expertise — connecting Mercury to LLMs, building the full Sky Omega stack
* EEE methodology guidance — applying Emergence, Epistemics, Engineering to your domain
* Architectural consultation — E-Clean & Semantic Architecture for your systems
* Co-development — building Lucy, James, Mira, and the layers above the substrate
* Early access to emerging components as the vision matures

We believe in earning trust through substance, not promises. The substrate is already public. The expertise to wield it travels with the builder.
