# Sky Omega â€“ A New Kind of Intelligence

Welcome to the public repository of **Sky Omega**, a project exploring the convergence of human creativity and artificial co-creation.

Sky Omega is an experiment.  

A philosophy.

A system. 

Born from real-world needs, informed by scientific discipline, and shaped through a deeply collaborative process, Sky Omega is unlike any AI-assisted development effort before it. It draws upon decades of software experience, the elegant structure of semantic web technologies like RDF, and a belief that knowledge itself can be shaped into something alive.

> ðŸŒ€ *This is a glimpse. Not the source.*

The full project lives in a private, ongoing research repository. What you see here are selected documents and essaysâ€”offered to seed ideas, inspire collaboration, and invite visionary supporters who see the future forming just ahead of the curve.
